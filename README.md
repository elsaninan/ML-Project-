# ML-Project-
Link Prediction on Twitch dataset
The aim of this project is to compare machine learning algorithms to find the algorithm that gives the best personalised friend recommendations to streamers on Twitch, which is an online platform for gamers. This is a binary classification problem - that is whether to recommend a user or not. The algorithms being compared are logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines and Extreme Learning Machine. There are 2 types of classifiers for classification in ELM. The performance of these classifiers when coupled with various activation functions is evaluated.
